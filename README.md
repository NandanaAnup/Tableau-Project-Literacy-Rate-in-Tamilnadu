# Tableau-Project-Literacy-Rate-in-Tamilnadu
# Objective
The objective of this dashboard is to analyze literacy trends in Tamil Nadu using census data, focusing on gender differences, population growth, district-wise performance, and educational support factors such as scholarships, institutions, teachers, and students. It provides policymakers and educators with insights into regional disparities, scholarship utilization, and resource allocation to drive improvements in literacy and education outcomes across the state.

# Insight
1. Total Population & Literacy Rate by District
The district-wise population and literacy chart shows that Chennai leads with the highest population at over 46 lakh, followed by Kancheepuram and Vellore. Despite having larger populations, these districts also maintain relatively high literacy rates—Chennai ranks first with 90.18%, while Vellore and Thiruvallur hover around 77–79%. On the other hand, districts like Perambalur (74.2%) and The Nilgiris (75.8%) remain in the lower band of literacy. This contrast highlights that while urban districts manage both high population and strong literacy, certain rural districts lag behind despite lower population pressures.

2. Scholarship / Beneficiaries of Students
The scholarship distribution analysis reveals an uneven pattern of utilization across districts. Coimbatore and Kancheepuram received the highest scholarship funds, crossing 200K and 180K beneficiaries respectively, yet they still fall under the amber zone (<75% literacy). In contrast, The Nilgiris, which received fewer scholarships, demonstrated efficient use of resources by maintaining literacy above 85%. This indicates that high funding does not automatically translate into better literacy outcomes, and the effectiveness of scholarship utilization plays a crucial role in driving educational improvements.
