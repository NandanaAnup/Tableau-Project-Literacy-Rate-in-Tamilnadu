# Tableau-Project-Literacy-Rate-in-Tamilnadu
# Objective
The objective of this dashboard is to analyze literacy trends in Tamil Nadu using census data, focusing on gender differences, population growth, district-wise performance, and educational support factors such as scholarships, institutions, teachers, and students. It provides policymakers and educators with insights into regional disparities, scholarship utilization, and resource allocation to drive improvements in literacy and education outcomes across the state.
# Steps followed:
1. Data Collection: The data was provided in the coursework.
2. Data Cleaning & Transformation: Used Tableau to clean and standardize the dataset,ensuring consistency across different data sources and time periods.
3. Visualization Creation: Designed interactive charts and maps in Tableau, including bar graphs, line trends, and comparative visuals to highlight district-wise literacy rates, population growth, scholarship distribution, institutional availability, and teacher–student dynamics.

# Insight
1. Total Population & Literacy Rate by District
The district-wise population and literacy chart shows that Chennai leads with the highest population at over 46 lakh, followed by Kancheepuram and Vellore. Despite having larger populations, these districts also maintain relatively high literacy rates—Chennai ranks first with 90.18%, while Vellore and Thiruvallur hover around 77–79%. On the other hand, districts like Perambalur (74.2%) and The Nilgiris (75.8%) remain in the lower band of literacy. This contrast highlights that while urban districts manage both high population and strong literacy, certain rural districts lag behind despite lower population pressures.

2. Scholarship / Beneficiaries of Students
The scholarship distribution analysis reveals an uneven pattern of utilization across districts. Coimbatore and Kancheepuram received the highest scholarship funds, crossing 200K and 180K beneficiaries respectively, yet they still fall under the amber zone (<75% literacy). In contrast, The Nilgiris, which received fewer scholarships, demonstrated efficient use of resources by maintaining literacy above 85%. This indicates that high funding does not automatically translate into better literacy outcomes, and the effectiveness of scholarship utilization plays a crucial role in driving educational improvements.

3. Number of Institutions Available
Institutional availability highlights the dominance of Nursery and Primary Schools, with over 30,000 institutions across the state, followed by Middle Schools and High Schools. This suggests that Tamil Nadu has invested heavily in early education infrastructure, ensuring broad access to foundational learning. However, as the levels progress to higher secondary and central board schools, the number of institutions drops significantly, reflecting a gap in advanced learning opportunities. This structural imbalance can potentially limit student progression beyond basic education levels.

4. Number of Teachers and Students
The teacher-student distribution analysis emphasizes a mismatch at higher levels of education. While Nursery and Primary Schools accommodate the largest share of students (over 3 million), they also have a large teaching base to balance ratios. Middle schools and high schools, especially under the state board, show a considerable number of students compared to relatively fewer teachers, creating pressure on the education system. Among SC and ST students, a majority complete middle school, but progression into matriculation and higher secondary remains limited. This suggests that while access to primary education is strong, bottlenecks appear in secondary education due to both institutional and teaching constraints.

# Conclusions
The overall analysis shows that Tamil Nadu has made strong progress in literacy, crossing 80% by 2011, supported by a robust network of primary schools and scholarship programs. However, district-level disparities, gender gaps, and weak progression beyond middle school highlight ongoing challenges. While urban districts like Chennai and Kancheepuram perform well, rural districts continue to lag, and scholarships are not always translating into better literacy outcomes. Teacher shortages at higher levels and limited advanced institutions further restrict student progression, especially for SC/ST groups. Addressing these structural gaps and ensuring effective resource utilization will be key to sustaining and improving literacy outcomes across the state.
